# Willow Kitchen — Project Evolution & Product Journey Documentation

> **Purpose**: This document provides an exhaustive, chronological trace of how **Willow Kitchen** evolved from an initial concept into a production-grade, multi-brand Cloud cloud kitchen order display and management system. It is designed to share back with AI Studio to document how operational features, UI/UX architecture, and simulation mechanics shaped up across development iterations.

## 1. System Vision & Core Architecture

Willow Kitchen is designed as an intelligent, high-throughput order management display tailored for modern cloud kitchens managing multiple virtual brands under one roof. Unlike traditional single-restaurant order displays, Willow Kitchen solves complex multi-brand routing, station load balancing, rider synchronization, and inventory loss prevention.

### Core Technology Stack:
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript & Vite
- **State Management**: Reactive ref-based state engine (`AppState`) running on a synchronized 1-second simulation tick loop.
- **Design System**: Custom Vanilla CSS design tokens (`--wk-vellum`, `--wk-oxblood`, `--wk-linen`, `--wk-ink`) enforcing a warm, high-contrast, premium aesthetic.

## Phase 1: Foundations & 4-Column Workflow

### Initial Problem Space:
Early dashboard interfaces struggled with visual clutter when handling incoming aggregator orders (Swiggy, Zomato, Direct App) alongside active preparation and rider pickups.

### Key Evolutions Implemented:
- **4-Column Operational Kanban**:
  1. **Column 1: New Orders (Incoming)** — Auto-accept countdowns, channel source badges, and single-click manual order acceptance.
  2. **Column 2: Cooking Now (Active Preparation)** — Real-time item cooking progress bars, SLA countdowns, and station breakdowns.
  3. **Column 3: Station Queues & Bulk Controls** — Individual station workload tracks (`Hot`, `Grill`, `Assembly`) with bulk action buttons (`Prep All`, `Hold All`, `Cook All`).
  4. **Column 4: Logistics & Handover** — Rider arrivals, packed orders, and order pickup dispatch.
- **SLA Remaining Time Sorting**: Orders in Column 2 (`Cooking Now`) were pinned strictly by least remaining SLA time at the top, giving kitchen staff immediate visibility into urgent tickets.

## Phase 2: Station Specialization & Group Prep Logic

### Operational Refinement:
In a high-volume kitchen, cooking identical items individually creates massive bottlenecks. However, batch cooking tags should only trigger when items genuinely benefit from joint preparation.

### Key Evolutions Implemented:
- **Targeted "Cooking Together" / Prep Together Logic**:
  - Algorithm updated so "Prep Together" tags only appear for genuine prep-together item candidates across active orders rather than universally attaching to all items.
- **Assembly Station Evolution**:
  - The 3rd station was explicitly refined and named **`Assembly Station`** (`Assembly`). It is designated specifically for assembling both cold items (salads, dips, burger buns, modifiers) and prepped fresh bowls.
- **Station Capacity & Workload Monitors**:
  - Header segment bars monitor real-time capacity across `Hot`, `Grill`, and `Assembly` stations, triggering automatic store throttling when workload hits 90%+.

## Phase 3: Logistics Automation & Column 4 Restructuring

### Operational Refinement:
Manager friction was reduced by eliminating manual packing confirmation clicks when riders are already present on-site.

### Key Evolutions Implemented:
- **Column 4 Restructuring into 3 Clear Sections**:
  1. **Section 1: Packed & Waiting** — Cooked and packed orders awaiting rider arrival.
  2. **Section 2: Riders Waiting** — Displayed in a compact, two-in-a-row grid featuring rider names, statuses, and one-click phone actions.
  3. **Section 3: Up for Grabs (Inventory Pool)** — Prepped items available for instant reassignment.
- **Zero-Click Auto-Handover & Celebration Animations**:
  - When an order finishes cooking and its assigned rider is already in `arrived` status, the system bypasses manual clicks, automatically hands over the order, and triggers a celebratory pickup notification toast (`🎉 Order #101 Picked Up & Delivered!`).

---

## Phase 4: Order Recovery & Up for Grabs Inventory

### Operational Refinement:
Food waste from customer cancellations during cooking or packing is a major cost driver in cloud kitchens.

### Key Evolutions Implemented:
- **Up for Grabs Inventory Holding Pool**:
  - When customers or kitchen staff cancel orders during cooking or in packed states, 100% of prepped items transition directly into the **`Up for Grabs`** holding pool in Column 4 (tagged with `canceledBy: 'Customer'` or `'Kitchen'`).
  - Items remain active in the pool for 30 simulated minutes with automated expiration countdowns.
- **Intelligent Item Reassignment**:
  - When new orders arrive matching items sitting in `Up for Grabs`, the system prompts staff (`↺ Use Up for Grabs Items`) to fulfill items instantly without re-cooking fresh stock.
  - Standardized terminology across all UI badges (`GRABS`, `↺ UP FOR GRABS`) and modals.

---

## Phase 5: Rebranding & Multi-Brand Menu Expansion

### Operational Refinement:
Transitioned generic naming into a distinct brand identity with dedicated menu architectures.

### Key Evolutions Implemented:
- **Willow Kitchen Identity**:
  - Rebranded code references, package manifests (`willow-kitchen`), HTML meta tags, and header banners featuring a custom vector Willow tree logo SVG.
- **Single-Brand Simulation Isolation**:
  - Order generator updated so incoming tickets strictly select items belonging to a single virtual brand (`Burger Craft`, `Grill House`, or `Bowl & Salad Co.`), avoiding unrealistic mixed-brand tickets.
- **10+ Items per Brand Expansion**:
  - Expanded each virtual brand to feature at least 10 realistic menu items.
  - Refined the **"+ New Order"** popup layout to use a full-height, hug-content grid (`width: 560px`) without internal scrollbars for seamless order creation.
  - Simplified manual order entry for cloud kitchens by removing unnecessary aggregator dropdowns and updating customer name placeholders (`e.g. Rahul S.`).

## Phase 6: Automated 5-Minute Rush Cycles & Shift Analytics

### Operational Refinement:
Provided shift managers with automated operational performance reviews at the conclusion of peak kitchen rushes.

### Key Evolutions Implemented:
- **Automated 5-Minute Rush Cycle (`300s`)**:
  - The kitchen operates in structured 5-minute simulation cycles.
- **Automated Screen Cleanup & Analytics Trigger**:
  - At the 5-minute mark, active tickets across all columns, waiting riders, and inventory pools automatically clear ("the whole thing becomes clean").
  - The system automatically pops open the **Rush Summary Analytics Modal**, analyzing:
    - **On-Time Order Completion Percentage**
    - **Average Preparation Velocity** (minutes per order)
    - **Busiest Station Peak Workload**
    - **Cold Storage & Order Rejection Metrics**
    - **Actionable AI Operational Tip for the Next Rush**
- **Clean Session Reset**: Clicking *"Close & Start Fresh"* resets kitchen metrics cleanly for the subsequent shift.
